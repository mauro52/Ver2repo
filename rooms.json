    "roomDesc": ["2","1","Torch sconces line the stone walls, casting flickering shadows across the dusty floor. A heavy iron door stands ajar, its hinges creaking softly in the stale air.", "Stone sarcophagi rest in alcoves along the walls, their lids adorned with faded runes. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and cobwebs cling to the ceiling like spectral veils.", "Shelves packed with dusty vials and jars line the walls, each containing mysterious substances of various hues. A bubbling cauldron sits atop a crackling fire, sending tendrils of colored smoke into the air.", "Piles of glittering gold coins and precious gems sparkle in the dim light, heaped upon ancient stone pedestals. Jeweled artifacts and ornate weapons are displayed upon velvet-lined shelves, their surfaces polished to a high sheen.", "Iron bars divide the cramped chambers, each containing a rusted cot and a straw-strewn floor. Faint echoes of distant moans and rattling chains fill the oppressive silence, lending an eerie atmosphere to the cold, damp air.", "A grand throne of ornately carved stone dominates the chamber, flanked by towering statues of forgotten kings. Tattered banners hang from the walls, their faded colors bearing the sigils of long-extinct noble houses."]
